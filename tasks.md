3. Allow different car types to be shown on the map randomly. In that case, car size must also go as an input to brain while training.


# P1 - Immediate
1. DO WE NEED SIMULATION - Simulation mode handling of targets (When simulation mode is started and there is no target in the world, start with adding a target followed by cars, else directly simulationEditor is enabled)
2. Show cars that reach target in a better way


# Done
1. Traffic light must be above all markings including cars.
